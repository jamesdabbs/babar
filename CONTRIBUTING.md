Contributions of any kind are welcome and encouraged, be they:

- Pull requests
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Words of encouragement
- :beer:

If you are interested in a particular feature, feel free to open an issue or 
send me an email.

If you've got a pull request, keeping coding style consistent would be cool - 
modulo a few parentheses, I tend to stick to the 
[GitHub Ruby style guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
